# ReflectaBot

ReflectaBot is a Telegram bot built with ASP.NET Core (.NET 8) designed to help users learn and retain knowledge from articles and web content. It uses AI to generate interactive summaries and quizzes from URLs provided by users.

## Features Implemented

- **Telegram Bot Integration:** Webhook-based communication using the `Telegram.Bot` library.
- **Basic User Handling:** Recognizes and stores Telegram users for personalized interactions.
- **Database Setup:** Entity Framework Core with SQLite for local development.
- **Article Processing:** Detects URLs, scrapes web content, and prepares for AI-powered summarization and quizzes.
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Integrated with Serilog for structured logging; logs can be sent directly to an ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for searching, visualization, and alerting.
- **Docker Support:** Project setup includes Docker configuration for easy deployment.

## Next Steps

- **AI Content Generation:** Integrate OpenAI (or similar) to generate article summaries and quiz questions.
- **Caching:** Efficiently store and reuse AI responses to minimize API usage and cost.
- **Interactive UI:** Add Telegram buttons for summary and quiz actions; handle callback queries.
- **Spaced Repetition:** Implement storage and scheduling of flashcards for each user to support daily review and learning.
- **Advanced Alerting:** Use Kibana to set up notifications for errors or important events.
- **Security Hardening:** Ensure secret tokens and sensitive data are securely managed.

## How to Run

1. Set up your environment variables (Telegram bot token, etc.).
2. Build and run the project with Docker or locally.
3. (Optional) Bring up ELK stack for log management and monitoring.
